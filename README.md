<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The model
This model is based on my thesis work - https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01566985 - It is an updated version of the model, once coded using Repast Simphony, while being recoded in a more suitable platform (Gama). Most of references remain the same while improved.

### Built With

* [GAMA-Platform](http://gama-platform.org)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Launch Model Simulations

To get a local copy of the model and be able to run experiment with it, improve or (freely) reuse.

### Prerequisites

- [GAMA-Platform 1.8.1](https://github.com/gama-platform/gama/releases/tag/1.8.1)

### Getting started

1. First, download and extract the proper GAMA version (see link below, if you don't know which version to take, pick the corresponding OS - windows, linux or macos - and prefer the one with embedded JDK). If you need more information about how to install GAMA, check the [installation page](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/Installation)

2. Second, clone the model on your computer (in a terminal go to the desired repository and inpu ``git clone https://github.com/chapuisk/S-at-work.git``) or download the model [on GitHub](https://github.com/chapuisk/S-at-work) (click [here](https://github.com/chapuisk/S-at-work/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) to download it automatically)

2.a Extract that ZIP file somewhere on your computer, if you downloaded it. 

3. [import the model in GAMA](https://gama-platform.github.io/wiki/ImportingModels).

4. Enjoy our model running on your computer.
